# Agora-server
Backend for Agora project

Agora is project that aims to create a non-official direct democratic virtual system, where people can vote for laws with
no political party affiliation, so that what really counts is the idea and there is not any kind of political bias when 
making decitions and therefore there's a way to know what the public opinion really is and compare results with reality.
